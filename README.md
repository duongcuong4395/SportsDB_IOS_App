### 3. Error Handling Documentation

The Soft Skills Simulation Platform uses a combination of custom error types and standard Swift error handling mechanisms.

*   **Domain Errors:** Custom error enums defined within each bounded context (e.g., `ContentModerationError`, `UserManagementError`, `RecommendationEngineError`).
*   **Application Errors:** Custom error enums defined within the Application layer (e.g., `ContentModerationApplicationError`, `UserManagementAppError`, `RecommendationEngineAppError`). These errors typically wrap domain errors or represent application-specific failures.
*   **Network Errors:** A `NetworkError` enum is used to represent network-related errors.
*   **Persistence Errors:** Custom errors specific to persistence operations (e.g., CoreDataError) in the Infrastructure layer.

**Example Error Handling Flow:**

1.  A request to register a user is received by the Presentation layer.
2.  The Presentation layer calls the `RegisterUserUseCase` in the Application layer.
3.  The `RegisterUserUseCase` calls the `AuthenticationService` in the Domain layer.
4.  The `AuthenticationService` calls the `UserRepository` in the Infrastructure layer to save the user to the database.
5.  If the database save fails, the `UserRepository` throws a `CoreDataError`.
6.  The `AuthenticationService` catches the `CoreDataError` and throws a `UserManagementError`.
7.  The `RegisterUserUseCase` catches the `UserManagementError` and throws a `UserManagementAppError`.
8.  The Presentation layer catches the `UserManagementAppError` and displays an appropriate error message to the user.

### 4. Integration Patterns

The Soft Skills Simulation Platform uses the following integration patterns:

*   **API:** Synchronous communication between bounded contexts (e.g., UserManagement -> InteractionSimulation, ScenarioManagement -> RecommendationEngine). REST API or GraphQL.
*   **Domain Events:** Asynchronous communication between bounded contexts (e.g., ScenarioManagement -> ContentModerationContext, InteractionSimulation -> ContentModerationContext).
*   **Message Broker:** Asynchronous communication using an in-memory Message Broker (for decoupling between contexts and asynchronous communication).
*   **Saga Pattern:** Coordination of complex workflows that span multiple bounded contexts (e.g., User Subscription, Content Moderation). The Saga Orchestrator manages the sequence of steps and compensating transactions.

## IV. Development Guidelines

### 1. Coding Standards

*   Follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
*   Use consistent naming conventions.
*   Write clear and concise code.
*   Document your code using Swift documentation markup.
*   Follow a consistent code formatting style.
*   Adhere to SOLID principles

### 2. Testing Strategies

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Write unit tests for all entities, value objects, domain services, use cases, and repositories.
    *   Use mock objects to isolate the component being tested.
    *   Verify that the code behaves as expected for both valid and invalid input.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Verify the interaction between different components or layers of the application.
    *   Test the integration with external services.
*   **UI Tests:**
    *   Verify that the UI behaves as expected and that the user can interact with the application correctly.
    *   Use XCUITest to automate UI tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage (80% or higher).
*   **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert - Structure tests to clearly identify the setup, the action being tested, and the expected outcome.
*   **Test Pyramid:** Follow the test pyramid concept: Write more unit tests than integration tests, and more integration tests than UI tests.
*   **Data Builders**: Create Data Builders to help setup your unit tests.

### 3. Deployment Procedures

*   **Code Signing:** Use code signing certificates to sign the application.
*   **Provisioning Profiles:** Use provisioning profiles to provision the application for testing and distribution.
*   **TestFlight:** Use TestFlight to distribute beta versions of the application to testers.
*   **App Store Connect:** Use App Store Connect to submit the application to the App Store.
*   **Automated Builds:** Automate the build process using Xcode Cloud, Jenkins, or another CI/CD tool.

### 4. Troubleshooting Guides

| Problem                                         | Solution                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Data migration fails                      | Ensure that the data model is correctly configured for auto-migration, with clear mapping definitions. Review migration logs for detailed errors.                           |
| Network requests failing                       | Check the API base URL configuration for the current environment, verify network connectivity, and inspect request and response details.                                    |
| AI Service returns unexpected results           | Inspect the input parameters sent to the AI service, review AI service documentation for any recent API changes, and verify API key validity.                           |
| Domain events not being processed               | Verify that the `EventBus` is correctly registered and that subscribers are properly listening for the events.                                                            |
| UI not updating correctly                       | Check that `@Published` properties are being updated on the main thread and that the UI elements are correctly bound to the view model.                                     |
| Crashes Due to Asynchronous Operations         | Use @MainActor and also DispatchQueue in the Presentation layer to work with MainThread and avoid the errors for that.                                                          |
